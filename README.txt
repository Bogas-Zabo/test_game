Little program using OpenGL about falling particles.
For now it's only purpose is to have a simple basis to then improve it further.
Perhaps in the future i will improve the intercation between the particles.

Done:
	Falling particles
	Add feature to pile up
	Add gravity
	Optimize a little
To do:
	Add momentum and inertia
	Add better optimization
	Refine the intercations and physics to simluate water, sand or gas
